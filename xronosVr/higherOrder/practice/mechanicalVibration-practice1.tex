\begin{exercise} \label{mv:exwt1}
    Using the mks units (meters-kilograms-seconds), suppose you have a spring with spring constant \unitfrac[4]{N}{m}. You want to use it to weigh items.  Assume no friction.  You place the mass on the spring and put it in motion. 
    
    You count and find that the frequency is \unit[0.8]{Hz} (cycles per second).  What is the mass? (Be careful with the units here, the frequency is given in cycles per second, not radians per second.)

    A mass of $2$ kilograms is on a spring with spring constant $k$ newtons per meter with no damping.  Suppose the system is at rest and at time $t=0$ the mass is kicked and starts traveling at 2 meters per second.  What's the minimum that $k$ has to be so that the mass does not go further than 3 meters from the rest position? $k = \answer{\frac{8}{9}}$

    Suppose you wish to measure the friction a mass of \unit[0.1]{kg} experiences as it slides along a floor (you wish to find $\gamma$).  You have a spring with spring constant $k=\unitfrac[5]{N}{m}$.  You take the spring, you attach it to the mass and fix it to a wall.  Then you pull on the spring and let the mass go.

\begin{exercise}
    For RLC circuits, we can use either charge or current to set up the equation. Let's see how the two of those compare.
    
    Assume that we have an RLC circuit with a 30 millihenry inductor, a 120 milliohm resistor, and a capacitor with capacitance $\frac{20}{3}$ F. Set up a differential equation for the charge on the capacitor as a function of time.
    $\answer{0.03}Q'' + \answer{0.12}Q' + \answer{\frac{3}{20}}Q = 0$
    \begin{problem} 
        Use the same circuit to set up a differential equation for the current through the circuit as a function of time. How do these equations relate? $\answer{0.03}I'' + \answer{0.12}I' + \answer{\frac{3}{20}}I = 0$
        \begin{problem}
            Find the general solution to each of these equations. [Use $A$ and $B$ for arbitrary constants] $Q(t) = \answer{Ae^{-2t}\cos(t) + Be^{-2t}\sin(t)}$
            \begin{problem}
                Solve the initial value problem for the charge with $Q(0) = \frac{1}{2} C$ and $Q'(0) = 0$. $Q(t) = \answer{\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}\cos(t) + e^{-2t}\sin(t)}$
                \begin{problem}
                    Using the fact that $I = Q'$, determine the appropriate initial conditions needed for $I$ in order to solve for the current in this same setup (with those initial values for charge). $I(0) = \answer{0}$, $I'(0) = \answer{-\frac{5}{2}}$
                    \begin{problem}
                        Now, we'll do the same in the other direction. Solve the initial value problem for current with $I(0) = 2 A$ and $I'(0) = 1 \unitfrac{A}{s}$, and see what the initial conditions would be for $Q(t)$ for this setup.
                        $I(t) = \answer{2e^{-2t}\cos(t) + 5e^{-2t}\sin(t)}$, $Q(0) = \answer{-\frac{9}{5}}$, $Q'(0) = \answer{2}$
