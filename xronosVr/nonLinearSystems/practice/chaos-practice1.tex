    Find critical points of the Lorenz system and the associated linearizations.

%Critical points: $(0,0,0)$, $(3\sqrt{8},3 \sqrt{8}, 27)$,
%$(-3 \sqrt{8},-3 \sqrt{8}, 27)$.
%Linearization at $(0,0,0)$ using $u=x$, $v=y$, $w=z$ is
%$u' = -10u+10v$, $v'=28u-v$, $w'=-(\frac{8}{3})w$.
%Linearization at $(3 \sqrt{8},3\sqrt{8},27)$ using $u=x-3\sqrt{8}$,
%$v=y-3\sqrt{8}$, $w=z-27$ is
%$u' = -10u+10v$, $v'=u-v-3\sqrt{8}w$, $w'=3\sqrt{8}u+3\sqrt{8}v-(\frac{8}{3})w$.

\begin{exercise}
    For the non-chaotic equation $x''+2p x' + \omega_0^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos (\omega t)$, suppose we strobe with frequency $\omega$ as we mentioned above.  Use the known steady periodic solution to find precisely the point which is the attractor for the Poincar\'e section.\\
    $(A, \omega B)$ for $A \answer{\cos(\omega t)} + B \answer{\sin(\omega t)}$, or $\answer{\frac{F_0/m}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2p\omega)^2}(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2, 2p\omega^2)}$

\begin{exercise}%[project]
    Construct the double pendulum described in the text with a string and two nuts (or heavy beads).  Play around with the position of the middle nut, and perhaps use different weight nuts.  Describe what you find.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}%[project]
    A simple fractal attractor can be drawn via the following chaos game.  Draw the three vertices of a triangle and label them, say $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$.  Draw some random point $p$ (it does not have to be one of the three points above). Roll a die to pick of the $p_1$, $p_2$, or $p_3$ randomly (for example 1 and 4 mean $p_1$, 2 and 5 mean $p_2$, and 3 and 6 mean $p_3$).  Suppose we picked $p_2$, then let $p_{\text{new}}$ be the point exactly halfway between $p$ and $p_2$.  Draw this point and let $p$ now refer to this new point $p_{\text{new}}$.  Rinse, repeat.  Try to be precise and draw as many iterations as possible.  Your points will be attracted to the so-called \emph{\myindex{Sierpinski triangle}}.  A computer was used to run the game for 10,000 iterations to obtain the picture in the figure below.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%[computer project]
    Use a computer software (such as Matlab, Octave, or perhaps even a spreadsheet), plot the solution of the given forced Duffing equation with Euler's method.  Plotting the solution for $t$ from 0 to 100 with several different (small) step sizes. Discuss.
\end{exercise}

%{%
%You should get very different behavior for similar (small) step sizes becasue the equation is chaotic.
