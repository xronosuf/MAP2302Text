    Take the \emph{damped nonlinear pendulum equation} $\theta '' + \mu \theta' + (\frac{g}{L}) \sin \theta = 0$ for some $\mu > 0$ (that is, there is some friction).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $\mu = 1$ and $\frac{g}{L} = 1$ for simplicity, find and classify the critical points.\\
            (Use $n$ as a dummy integer.) $\left(\answer{n \pi}, \answer{0}\right)$, $n$ is \wordChoice{\choice{even}\choice[correct]{odd}} is a saddle, $n$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{even}\choice{odd}} is a spiral sink.
        \item Do the same for any $\mu > 0$ and any $g$ and $L$, but such that the damping is small, in particular, $\mu^2 < 4(\frac{g}{L})$.
        \item Explain what your findings mean, and if it agrees with what you expect in reality.\\
            Oscillates decaying to $\theta = \answer{0}$

\begin{exercise}%
    Take the damped nonlinear pendulum equation $\theta '' + \mu \theta' + (\frac{g}{L}) \sin \theta = 0$ for some $\mu > 0$ (that is, there is friction). Suppose the friction is large, in particular $\mu^2 > 4 (\frac{g}{L})$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find and classify the critical points.\\
            Critical points are $\omega = \answer{0}$, which is a saddle point, and $\theta= \answer{k\pi}$ for any integer $k$, which is a saddle point when $k$ is \wordChoice{\choice{even}\choice[correct]{odd}} and a sink when $k$ is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{even}\choice{odd}}.
        \item Explain what your findings mean, and if it agrees with what you expect in reality.
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%a) Critical points are $\omega=0$, $\theta=k\pi$ for any integer $k$.  When
%$k$ is odd, we have a saddle point.  When $k$ is even we get a sink.  \quad
%b)~The findings mean the pendulum will simply go to one of the sinks, for
%example $(0,0)$ and it will not swing back and forth.  The friction is too high for it to
%oscillate, just like an overdamped mass-spring system.

\begin{exercise}
    Suppose the hares do not grow exponentially, but logistically.  In particular consider
    \begin{equation*}
        x' = (0.4-0.01y)x - \gamma x^2, \qquad y' = (0.003x-0.3)y .
    \end{equation*}
    For the following two values of $\gamma$, find and classify all the critical points in the positive quadrant, that is, for $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$.  Then sketch the phase diagram.  Discuss the implication for the long term behavior of the population.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\gamma=0.001$, 
            $\left(\answer{0}, \answer{0}\right)$, which is a saddle,           \\

            $\left(\answer{100}, \answer{30}\right)$, which is a spiral sink.   \\

\begin{exercise}%
    Suppose we have the system predator-prey system where the foxes are also killed at a constant rate $h$ ($h$ foxes killed per unit time): $x' = (a-by)x,$  $y' = (cx-d)y - h$.
    
    Find the critical points and the Jacobian matrices of the system.\\
    Critical Points: $\left(\answer{0}, \answer{-\frac{h}{d}}\right)$ and $\left(\answer{\frac{bh+ad}{ac}}, \answer{\frac{a}{b}}\right)$.\\
    \begin{problem}
        The Jacobian matrix at $(0,-\frac{h}{d})$ is:

            Put in the constants $a=0.4$, $b=0.01$, $c=0.003$, $d=0.3$, $h=10$. Analyze the critical points.  \\%What do you think it says about the forest?
            For the specific numbers given, the second critical point is: $\left(\answer{\frac{550}{3}}, \answer{40}\right)$ and the matrix is:\\
            $\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}

    \end{problem}
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%a) Solving for the critical points we get
%$(0,-\frac{h}{d})$ and $(\frac{bh+ad}{ac},\frac{a}{b})$.
%The Jacobian matrix at
%$(0,-\frac{h}{d})$ is
%$\left[
%\begin{smallmatrix}
%a+bh/d & 0 \\
%-ch/d & -d
%\end{smallmatrix}
%\right]$
%whose eigenvalues are $a+bh/d$ and $-d$.  So the eigenvalues are always real of
%opposite signs and we get a saddle (In the application however we are only looking at the
%positive quadrant so this critical point is not relevant).
%At $(\frac{bh+ad}{ac},\frac{a}{b})$ we get Jacobian matrix
%$\left[
%\begin{smallmatrix}
%0 & -\frac{b \left( b h+a d\right) }{a c}\\
%\frac{a c}{b} & \frac{b h+a d}{a}-d

%b)~For the specific numbers given, the second critical point is
%$(\frac{550}{3},40)$
%the matrix is
%$\left[
%\begin{smallmatrix}
%0 & -11/6 \\
%3/25 & 1/4
%\end{smallmatrix}
%\right]$, which has eigenvalues $\frac{5\pm i \sqrt{327}}{40}$.  Therefore
%there is a spiral source.  This means the solution spirals
%outwards.  The solution will eventually hit one of the axes, $x=0$ or $y=0$,
%so something will die out in the forest.

\begin{exercise}%[challenging]%
    \begin{hint}
        Think of the constant of motion.
    \end{hint}
    Suppose the foxes never die.  That is, we have the system $x' = (a-by)x,$ $y' = cxy$. Find the critical points and notice they are not isolated. What will happen to the population in the forest if it starts at some positive numbers.  
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%The critical points are on the line $x=0$.  In the positive
%quadrant the $y'$ is always positive and so the fox population always grows.
%The constant of motion is $C = y^ae^{-cx-by}$, for any $C$ this curve must
%hit the $y$-axis (why?), so the trajectory will simply approach a point on the $y$
%axis somewhere and the number of hares will go to zero.

    Suppose that for the pendulum equation we take a trajectory giving the spinning-around motion, for example $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2g}{L} \cos \theta + \frac{2g}{L} + \omega_0^2}$.  This is the trajectory where the lowest angular velocity is $\omega_0^2$.  Find an integral expression for how long it takes the pendulum to go all the way around.

    Consider a predator-prey interaction where humans have gotten involved. The idea is that at least one of the species is valuable for food or another resource, and the two species still intact in their normal predator-prey manner. The first version of this will deal with ``constant effort harvesting,'' which means that humans will remove animals from the populations are a rate proportional to the population. This results in equations of the form
    \[ 
        \frac{dx}{dt} = x(a - by - E_1) \qquad \frac{dy}{dt} = y(-d + cx - E_2) 
    \]

        \item Without doing any mathematical work, what do you think will happen to the equilibrium solution if just the prey is harvested? What if just the predator is harvested? What if both are harvested?
        \item Find the location of the equilibrium system in each of the three cases in the previous part. Do this in terms of the constants $E_1$ and $E_2$ for all three cases. \\

    The second version of this will deal with ``constant yield harvesting,'' which means that humans will remove animals from the populations at a fixed rate, no matter their population. This results in equations of the form

    where $\rho$ indicates the growth rate, $M$ is related to the carrying capacity, and $\gamma$ is connected to the interaction term.

We want to analyze the behavior of this equation under different sets of coefficients.

%We have a conservative equation and so (exercise) the
%trajectories are given by
%\begin{equation*}
%\omega = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{2g}{L} \cos \theta + C} ,
%\end{equation*}
%for various values of $C$.  Let us figure out what $C$ corresponds to an
%initial condition $(0,\omega_0)$.  A little bit of thought tells us that
%such a $C = \omega_0^2 - \frac{2g}{L}$.  Taking just the top part of the
%trajectory we get
%\begin{equation*}
%\omega = \sqrt{ \frac{2g}{L} \cos \theta - \frac{2g}{L} + \omega_0^2} .
%\end{equation*}
%What we are trying to do is figure out when this will have no
%\myquote{gaps,} that
%is when what is under the square root is always positive.  The minimum is
%clearly taken when $\theta$ is an odd multiple of $\pi$, in this case we
%will get precisely zero when
%\begin{equation*}
%0 = \frac{2g}{L} \cos \pi - \frac{2g}{L} + \omega_0^2 ,
%\end{equation*}
%or in other words, solving for $\omega_0$ (and assuming it is positive) we
%have
%\begin{equation*}
%\omega_0 = 2 \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} .
%\end{equation*}
%In the case we graphed, that is when $\frac{g}{L} = 1$, then this magic
%$\omega_0 = 2$.  Notice that the trajectory that seems to go through the 
%saddle points goes through the point $(0,2)$.
