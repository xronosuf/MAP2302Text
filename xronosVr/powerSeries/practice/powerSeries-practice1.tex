\begin{exercise}
    Is the power series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty {(0.1)}^n x^n$ convergent? If so, what is the radius of convergence?

\begin{exercise}
    Determine the Taylor series and its radius of convergence of $\dfrac{1}{1+x}$ around $x_0 = 0$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Determine the Taylor series and its radius of convergence of $\dfrac{x}{4-x^2}$ around $x_0 = 0$.  Hint: You will not be able to use the ratio test.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Expand $x^5+5x+1$ as a power series around $x_0 = 5$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%
    Using the geometric series, expand $\frac{1}{1-x}$ around $x_0=2$. For what $x$ does the series converge?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%$\frac{1}{1-x} = -\frac{1}{1-(2-x)}$ so
%$\frac{1}{1-x} =
%\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty {(-1)}^{n+1} {(x-2)}^n$,
%which converges for $1 < x < 3$.

\begin{exercise}
    Suppose that the ratio test applies to a series $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k$.  Show, using the ratio test, that the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is the same as that of the original series.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Suppose that $f$ is an analytic function such that $f^{(n)}(0) = n$.  Find $f(1)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}%[challenging]%
    Imagine $f$ and $g$ are analytic functions such that $f^{(k)}(0) = g^{(k)}(0)$ for all large enough $k$.  What can you say about $f(x)-g(x)$?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%$f(x)-g(x)$ is a polynomial.  Hint: Use Taylor series.
