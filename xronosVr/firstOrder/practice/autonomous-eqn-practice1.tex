\begin{exercise}
    A disease is spreading through the country.  Let $x$ be the number of people infected.  Let the constant $S$ be the number of people susceptible to infection.  The infection rate $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is proportional to the product of already infected people, $x$, and the number of susceptible but uninfected people, $S-x$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the differential equation? $\frac{dx}{dt} = \answer{k(x)(S - x)}$
        \item Supposing $x(0) > 0$, that is, some people are infected at time $t=0$, what is $\displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} x(t)$. $\answer{S}$
        \item Does the solution to part b) agree with your intuition?  Why or why not?
