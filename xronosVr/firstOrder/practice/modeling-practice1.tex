\begin{exercise}
    Suppose there are two lakes located on a stream.  Clean water flows into the first lake, then the water from the first lake flows into the second lake, and then water from the second lake flows further downstream. The in and out flow from each lake is 500 liters per hour. The first lake contains 100 thousand liters of water and the second lake contains 200 thousand liters of water. A truck with 500 kg of toxic substance crashes into the first lake.  Assume that the water is being continually mixed perfectly by the stream.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find the concentration of toxic substance as a function of time in both lakes. $c_1(t) = \answer{\frac{1}{200}e^{-t/200}}$, $c_2(t) = \answer{\frac{1}{200}(e^{-t/400} - e^{-t/200})}$
        \item When will the concentration in the first lake be below 0.001 kg per liter? $\answer{321.89}$ hours. [Round your answer to two decimal places]
        \item When will the concentration in the second lake be maximal? $\answer{277.26}$ hours. [Round your answer to two decimal places]

    Newton's law of cooling states that $\frac{dx}{dt} = -k(x-A)$ where $x$ is the temperature, $t$ is time, $A$ is the ambient temperature, and $k > 0$ is a constant. Suppose that $A = A_0 \cos (\omega t)$ for some constants $A_0$ and $\omega$. That is, the ambient temperature oscillates (for example night and day temperatures).
