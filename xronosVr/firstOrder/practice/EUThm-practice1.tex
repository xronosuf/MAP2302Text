\begin{exercise}%
    Is it possible to solve $y' = xy$ for $y(0) = 0$?  Is the solution unique?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%Yes a solution exists.  $y' = f(x,y)$ where $f(x,y) = xy$.  The function
%$f(x,y)$ is continuous and 
%$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x$, which is also continuous near $(0,0)$.
%So a solution exists and is unique.  (In fact $y=0$ is the solution).
%}

\begin{exercise}%
    Is it possible to solve $y' = \frac{x}{x^2-1}$ for $y(1) = 0$?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%No, the equation is not defined at $(x,y) = (1,0)$.
%}

\begin{exercise}[tricky]%
    Suppose
    \begin{equation*}
        f(y) =
        \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{ if $y > 0$}, \\
            1 & \text{ if $y \leq 0$} .
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Does $y' = f(y)$, $y(0) = 0$ have a continuously differentiable solution?  Does Picard apply?  Why, or why not?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%Picard does not apply as $f$ is not continuous at $y=0$.
%The equation does not have a continuously differentiable solution.
%Suppose it did. Notice that
%$y'(0) = 1$.  By the first derivative test, $y(x) > 0$ for small positive $x$.
%But then for those $x$ we would have $y'(x) = 0$, so clearly the derivative
%cannot be continuous.
%}

\begin{exercise}%
    Consider an equation of the form $y' = f(x)$ for some continuous function $f$, and an initial condition $y(x_0) = y_0$.  Does a solution exist for all $x$?  Why or why not?
\end{exercise}
%\exsol{%
%The solution is $y(x) = \int_{x_0}^x f(s) \,ds + y_0$, and this does indeed
%exist for every $x$.
