\begin{exercise}
    Start with the logistic equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(M-x)$. Suppose we modify our harvesting. That is we will only harvest  an amount proportional to current population. In other words, we harvest $hx$ per unit of time for some $h > 0$ (Similar to earlier example with $h$ replaced with $hx$).
    \begin{tasks}
        \task Construct the differential equation. 
        \task Show that if $kM > h$, then the equation is still logistic.
        \task What happens when $kM < h$?
    \end{tasks}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Assume that a population of fish in a lake satisfies $\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(M-x)$.  Now suppose that fish are continually added at $A$ fish per unit of time.
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task Find the differential equation for $x$.
        \task What is the new limiting population?
    \end{tasks}
\end{exercise}

%a) $\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(M-x)+A$
%\quad
%b) $\frac{kM + \sqrt{{(kM)}^2 + 4Ak}}{2k}$

\begin{exercise}
    Consider the differential equation with parameter $\alpha$ given by $y' = y(y - \alpha + 1)$. 
    \begin{tasks}
        \task Sketch a phase diagram for this differential equation with $\alpha = -3$, $\alpha = 1$, and $\alpha = 3$. 
        \task Draw a bifurcation diagram for this differential equation with parameter. 
        \task What is the bifurcation point for this equation? What changes when $\alpha$ passes over the bifurcation point?
    \end{tasks}

%c)~$\alpha = 1$. The solution at $y=0$ changes stability.
