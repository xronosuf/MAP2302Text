\begin{exercise}
    Start with the logistic equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(M-x)$. Suppose we modify our harvesting. That is we will only harvest an amount proportional to current population. In other words, we harvest $hx$ per unit of time for some $h > 0$ (Similar to earlier example with $h$ replaced with $hx$).
    
    Construct the differential equation: $\frac{dx}{dt} = \answer{kx\left(\frac{Mk-h}{k} - x\right)}$
    \begin{problem}
        If $kM > h$, then what can you say about the equation?
        \begin{multipleChoice}
            \choice{The equation is no longer logistic.}
            \choice[correct]{The equation is still logistic.}
            \choice{It depends - so we can't answer without more information.}
        \end{multipleChoice}
        \begin{problem}
            What happens when $kM < h$?
            \begin{multipleChoice}
                \choice{The population always increases.}
                \choice{The population doesn't change.}
                \choice{The population fluctuates - increasing sometimes and decreasing sometimes.}
                \choice[correct]{The population always decreases.}
            \end{multipleChoice}
        \end{problem}

\begin{exercise}
    Assume that a population of fish in a lake satisfies $\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(M-x)$.  Also suppose that fish are continually added at $A$ fish per unit of time.
    
    Find the differential equation for $x$: $\frac{dx}{dt} = \answer{kx(M-x) + A}$
    \begin{problem}
        What is the new limiting population? $\answer{\frac{kM + \sqrt{{(kM)}^2 + 4Ak}}{2k}}$
