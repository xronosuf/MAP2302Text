<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">Stuff about Modeling with First Order Equations
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
<a class="ximera-label" id="modelfirst:section"></a>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent">One of the main reasons to study and learn about differential equations, particularly for scientists and engineers, is their
application and use in mathematical modeling. Since the derivative of a function represents the rate of change of that quantity, if
we can use physical or scientific principles to develop an equation for the rate of change of some quantity in terms of the quantity
and time, there’s a chance that we can write a differential equation for this quantity and solve it to determine how the quantity
will change.
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Principles of Mathematical Modeling</h4>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">The process of mathematical modeling involves three main steps. The first of these is to write the model. This part comes from
basic science or engineering principles and involves writing a differential equation that fits the given situation. If we can determine
the rate at which a quantity will change based on the surrounding factors, we have a good shot of getting to such an equation. One
main principle that can be used to write these equations is the accumuilation equation, which will be discussed in the next
subsection.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="noindent">The second step of this process is to solve the differential equation. This can mean either an analytic solution or a numeric one,
and this is where the work of this class comes into play. We are going through a bunch of different techniques for solving
differential equations and analyzing the overall behavior of such equations so that we can use them in this way. The
end goal is to get an equation or a graph for how the quantity that we made a model for is going to change in
time.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="noindent">The final step of the process is to validate the model by comparing with experimental data. Once we have written the model and
solved the corresponding differential equation, we want to make sure that the model works. To do this, we can take a new version
of the original scenario, run the model as well as the physical experiment and see how the results compare. If the results
are “close” (in whatever sense makes logical sense for the problem), then we have a good model and can keep it.
However, if our results differ significantly, then the model we used probably doesn’t apply to this problem. We need
to go back to step 1 to try to figure out a better model for the physical situation in order to get more accurate
results.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="noindent">Why do we care about mathematical modeling? The biggest thing that it does from an engineering point of view is reduce the need
for repeated testing. If we have a mathematical model that works for a given physical system, we can see how the
system will be have under slightly different conditions and with different initial conditions without needing to
run the physical experiment over and over again. We can do all of this testing on the model, and since we have
validated the model, we can assume that the actual results will be similar. This also allows us to change some
aspects of the physical situation to try to optimize it, but do so just by modifying the mathematical model, not the
physical setup. This can significantly cut down on costs and allow for more optimal system design at the same
time.
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>The Accumulation Equation</h4>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">The accumulation equation is one of the simplest general mathematical formulations that can be used to develop mathematical
models. This equation comes down to the fact that the rate of change of some quantity should be equal to the rate at which it is
being added minus the rate at which it is being removed. If we let <script type="math/tex">x</script> be the quantity in question, this can be written as
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation} 
    \frac{dx}{dt} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out}.
    \label{accum:eqn}
\end{equation}</script>
This may seem fairly simple. However, it shows up in many places in science and engineering. Any mass or energy
balance equations are examples of accumulation equations. These types of equations can also be written for the
accumulation of momentum, and doing so for fluids gives rise to the Navier-Stokes equations, providing the basis for
several fields of engineering. The examples that we see here will be simpler than that, but the idea is still the
same.
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem1"><a id="x1-2001r1"></a>A tank initially contains 70 gallons of water and 5 lbs of salt. A solution with salt concentration 0.2 lbs per gallon flows into the
tank at a rate of <script type="math/tex">3</script> gal/min. The tank is well stirred, and water is removed from the tank at a rate of <script type="math/tex">3</script> gal/min. Find the amount of
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                     
salt in the tank at any time <script type="math/tex">t</script>? What happens as <script type="math/tex">t\rightarrow \infty </script>? Does this make sense?
</div>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent">Solution: To solve this problem, we use the accumulation equation (<a class="reference" href="#accum:eqn">accum:eqn</a>) on the amount of salt in the
tank. In order to compute with this, we recognize that in terms of mass of salt moving into the tank
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        \text{rate in} = \text{flow in} \times \text{concentration in}
    \end{equation*}</script>
and similarly for the mass of salt leaving the tank.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent">If we let <script type="math/tex">x</script> represent the amount of salt in the tank at any time <script type="math/tex">t</script> (which is the goal of the problem),
we can write a differential equation for this using the accumulation equation (<a class="reference" href="#accum:eqn">accum:eqn</a>). This gives us that
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        \frac{dx}{dt} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out} = \text{flow in} \times \text{concentration in} - \text{flow out} \times \text{concentration out}
    \end{equation*}</script>
For this problem, we have that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
             \text{flow in} &= 3 , \\
        \text{concentration in} &= 0.2 , \\
        \text{flow out} &= 3 , \\
        \text{concentration out} &= \frac{x}{\text{volume}} = \frac{x}{70}.
    \end{align*}</script>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent">The last of these lines comes from the fact that the tank is “well stirred” or “well-mixed.” This implies that the concentration of
salt in the water leaving the tank is the same as the concentration in the tank, which we can compute as <script type="math/tex">\frac {x}{\text {volume}}</script>. In this case, since the
flow rate in and out are both 3 gal/min, the volume of water in the tank is fixed at <script type="math/tex">70</script> gallons, so we can put this in the
equation.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="noindent">Therefore, our equation becomes </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             \frac{dx}{dt} = (3\times 0.2) - \left(3 \times \frac{x}{70}\right).
    \end{equation*}</script>
We can rewrite this equation as <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{3}{70}x = 0.6
    \end{equation*}</script>
which we recognize as a first order linear equation. We can then solve this using the method of integrating factors. Our factor <script type="math/tex">r(t)</script> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        r(t) = e^{\int p(t)\, dt} = e^{\int \frac{3}{70}\, dt} = e^{\frac{3}{70} t},
    \end{equation*}</script>
which we can multiply on both sides of the equation to obtain
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        e^{\frac{3}{70} t} \frac{dx}{dt} + e^{\frac{3}{70} t} \frac{3}{70} x = 0.6 e^{\frac{3}{70} t}.
    \end{equation*}</script>
The left side of this is a product rule derivative, so we can integrate both sides to obtain
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        e^{\frac{3}{70} t} x = 0.6 \frac{70}{3} e^{\frac{3}{70} t} + C.
    \end{equation*}</script>
We can then isolate <script type="math/tex">x</script> to get our general solution as <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             x = 14 + Ce^{-\frac{3}{70} t}.
    \end{equation*}</script>
Our initial condition tells us that <script type="math/tex">x(0) = 5</script>. Plugging this in gives that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             5 = x(0) = 14 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = -9,
    \end{equation*}</script>
so the solution to the initial value problem, and thus our calculation for the amount of salt in the tank at any time <script type="math/tex">t</script>, is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        x(t) = 14 - 9e^{-\frac{3}{70} t}.
    \end{equation*}</script>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent">As <script type="math/tex">t\rightarrow \infty </script>, we see that the exponential term goes to zero. This leaves us with 14 lbs of salt in the tank after a long time. This makes some
sense because this would give us a concentration of <script type="math/tex">\frac {14}{70} = 0.2</script> lb/gal, and that was exactly the concentration of the in-flow stream. It makes
sense that after a long time of mixing and removing water from the tank, the concentration of the tank would match that of the
incoming stream.
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="noindent">                                                                                                   ___
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="noindent">The same principle works for other types of examples, including those where the volume of the tank is not constant in
time.

of 3 liters a minute. How much salt is in the tank when the tank is full?

which is valid and well defined for all positive values of <script type="math/tex">t</script> (it has an issue at <script type="math/tex">t=-30</script>, but we aren’t concerned about that here). However, as
a differential equation that represents a physical situation, it is not valid for all positive values of <script type="math/tex">t</script>. The issue here is that the tank
is full at <script type="math/tex">t=20</script>. Therefore, beyond this point, while the function still exists, it is not a valid model for this physical system. Once the
tank fills, you can’t keep adding and removing water at the same rates that you have been up until this point, because something is
going to break with the system. The same goes for if you are removing water from the tank at a faster rate than you are adding it,
because then the tank will empty at some point in time and beyond that, the model equation no longer represents the
system.
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent">The same ideas apply to problems involving interest compounded continuously. For an interest rate of <script type="math/tex">r</script>, the “rate in,” or the rate at
which the money in the account is increasing, is <script type="math/tex">rP</script> where <script type="math/tex">P</script> is the amount of money in the account. Taking this along with other
factors that may affect the balance of the account allows us to write a differential equation, which we can solve to determine what
the balance will be over time.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem3"><a id="x1-2005r3"></a>A bank account with an interest rate of <script type="math/tex">6\%</script> per year, compounded continuously, starts with a balance of $30000. The owner of the
account withdraws $50 from the account each month. Find and solve a differential equation for the account balance over time.
What is the largest amount that the owner could withdraw each month without the account eventually reaching
$0?
</div>
<!--l. 203--><p class="noindent">Solution: We will use the function <script type="math/tex">P(t)</script> to model the balance of the account over time, where <script type="math/tex">t</script> is in <em>years</em>. Since the owner withdraws
$50 per month, this means that they withdraw $600 over the course of the year. This means that the differential equation we want
is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {dP}{dt} = 0.06P - 600 \qquad P(0) = 30000. </script> We can solve this equation by the integrating factor method. <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin {split} P' - 0.06P &= -600 \\ (e^{-0.06t}P)' &= -600e^{-0.06t} \\ e^{-0.06t}P &= 10000e^{-0.06t} + C \\ P &= 10000 + Ce^{0.06t} \end {split} </script> For <script type="math/tex">P(0) = 30000</script>, we need to take <script type="math/tex">C = 20000</script>. Thus, the solution to the initial value
problem is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(t) = 10000 + 20000e^{0.06 t}. </script> Since the coefficient in front of <script type="math/tex">e^{0.06t}</script> is positive, this means that the account balance here will grow in
time.
</p><!--l. 222--><p class="noindent">For the second part, we need to adjust the withdrawal amount to see how the solution changes. If we let <script type="math/tex">K</script> be the monthly
withdrawal amount, then we have the differential equation <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {dP}{dt} = 0.06P - 12K \qquad P(0) = 30000. </script> The same solution method gives us <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(t) = \frac {12K}{0.06} + Ce^{0.06t}. </script>
</p><!--l. 227--><p class="noindent">If <script type="math/tex">C < 0</script>, then the account balance will eventually go to zero. Therefore, we need <script type="math/tex">C \geq 0</script>, and since <script type="math/tex">P(0) = 30000</script>, we have that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 30000 = \frac {12K}{0.06} + C \quad \text { or } \quad C = 30000 - \frac {12K}{0.06}. </script> For this to be equal to zero,
we need <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {12K}{0.06} = 30000 \qquad K = 150. </script> Thus, the owner can withdraw $150 per month and keep the account balance positive.

</p><!--l. 238--><p class="noindent">To end this section, we will analyze the example that was presented at the very beginning of the book.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem4"><a id="x1-2006r4"></a>An object falling through the air has its velocity affected by two factors: gravity and a drag force. The velocity
downward is increased at a rate of <script type="math/tex">9.8\ m/s^2</script> due to gravity, and it is decreased by a rate equation to <script type="math/tex">0.3</script> times the current
velocity of the object. If the ball is initially thrown downwards at a speed of <script type="math/tex">2\ m/s</script>, what will the velocity be 10 seconds
later?
</div>
<!--l. 245--><p class="noindent">Solution: As described in that first section, we know that the differential equation that we can write for this situation is
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - 0.3v
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                     
    \end{equation*}</script>
and that the initial condition for the velocity if <script type="math/tex">v(0) = 2</script>. Since we have gravity as a positive 9.8, this means that the downward direction is
positive, so the object being thrown downward at <script type="math/tex">2\ m/s</script> means that it is positive. We then need to solve this initial value problem, which
we can do using first order linear methods. The equation can be written as <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             v' + 0.3v = 9.8
    \end{equation*}</script>
which has integrating factor <script type="math/tex">e^{0.3t}</script>. After multiplying this to both sides and integrating, we get that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        e^{0.3t}v = \frac{9.8}{0.3}e^{0.3t} + C
    \end{equation*}</script>
or that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             v(t) = \frac{9.8}{0.3} + Ce^{-0.3t}.
    \end{equation*}</script>
<!--l. 260--><p class="noindent">Using the initial condition, we get that </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             v(0) = \frac{98}{3} + C = 2
    \end{equation*}</script>
so that <script type="math/tex">C = -\frac {92}{3}</script> and the solution to the initial value problem is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             v(t) = \frac{98}{3} - \frac{92}{3}e^{-0.3t}.
    \end{equation*}</script>
Then, to determine the velocity at <script type="math/tex">t=10</script>, we can plug <script type="math/tex">10</script> into this formula to get that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             v(10) = \frac{98}{3} - \frac{92}{3}e^{-3} \approx 31.14\ m/s.

</p><!--l. 274--><p class="noindent">All of these examples are based around the same idea of the accumulation equation. We need to determine the quantity that is
changing as well as all of the factors that cause it to increase and decrease. These get combined into a differential equation which
we can solve in order to analyze the situation and answer whatever questions you want about that physical problem. Keeping these
ideas in mind will help you approach a wide variety of problems both in this class as well as future applications in engineering
classes and beyond.
