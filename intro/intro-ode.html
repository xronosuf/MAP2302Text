<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent">Consider the following situation:
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 26--><p class="noindent">An object falling through the air has its velocity affected by two factors: gravity and a drag force. The velocity
     downward is increased at a rate of <script type="math/tex">9.8\ m/s^2</script> due to gravity, and it is decreased by a rate equation to <script type="math/tex">0.3</script> times the current
     velocity of the object. If the ball is initially thrown downwards at a speed of <script type="math/tex">2\ m/s</script>, what will the velocity be 10
     seconds later?</p></div>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent">There might be enough information here to determine the velocity at any later point in time (it turns out, there is) but the
information given isn’t really about the velocity. Rather, information is given about the rate of change of the velocity. We know
that the velocity will be increased at a rate of <script type="math/tex">9.8 m/s^2</script> due to gravity. How can this be interpreted? The rate of change has been discussed
previously way back in Calculus 1; this is the derivative. Thus, if we let the unknown function <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script> represent the velocity of the object,
the description above gives information about the derivative of this function for<script type="math/tex">v(t)</script>. Taking the two different factors
(the increase and decrease of velocity) into account, we can write an expression for this derivative, giving that
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    \frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - 0.3v.
\end{equation*}</script>
Even though we don’t know what <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script> is, we know that it must affect the derivative of the velocity in this particular way, so we can
write this equation. That’s why we give a name to this function, so that we can use it in writing this question, which, since it is an
equation involving the derivative of an unknown function <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script>, we call this a differential equation. Our goal here would be to use this
information, plus the fact that the velocity at time zero is <script type="math/tex">v(0) = 2\ \text {m/s}</script> to find the value of <script type="math/tex">v(10)</script>, or, more generally, the function <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script> for any
<script type="math/tex">t</script>.
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent">The laws of physics, beyond just that of simple velocity, are generally written down as differential equations. Therefore, all of
science and engineering use differential equations to some degree. Understanding differential equations is essential to understanding
almost anything you will study in your science and engineering classes. You can think of mathematics as the language of science,
and differential equations are one of the most important parts of this language as far as science and engineering are concerned. As
an analogy, suppose all your classes from now on were given half in Swahili and half in English. It would be important to
first learn Swahili, or you would have a very tough time getting a good grade in your classes. Without it, you
might be able to make sense of some of what is going on, but would definitely be missing an important part of the
picture.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem1"><a id="x1-1001r1"></a>A <em>differential equation</em> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. For a differential equation, the
<em>order</em> of the differential equation is the highest order derivative that appears in the equation.
</div>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent">One example of a first order differential equation is </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation} 
\label{eq1}
    \frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 \cos t .
\end{equation}</script>
Here <script type="math/tex">x</script> is the <em>dependent variable</em> and <script type="math/tex">t</script> is the <em>independent variable</em>. Note that we can use any letter we want for the dependent and
independent variables. This equation arises from Newton’s law of cooling where the ambient temperature oscillates with
time.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent">To make sure that everything is well-defined, we will assume that we can always write our differential equation with the highest
order derivative written as a function of all lower derivatives and the independent variable. For the previous example, since we can
write (<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>) as <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {dx}{dt} = 2\cos t - x </script> where the highest derivative <script type="math/tex">x'</script> is written as a function of <script type="math/tex">t</script> and <script type="math/tex">x</script>, we have a proper differential equation. On the other
hand, something like </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation} 
      \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + y^2 = 1 \label{eqNonDiff}
\end{equation}</script>
is not a proper differential equation because we can’t solve for <script type="math/tex">\frac {dy}{dt}</script>. This expression could either be written as
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {dy}{dt} = \sqrt {1 - y^2} \qquad \text {or} \qquad \frac {dy}{dt} = -\sqrt {1 - y^2}, </script>
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                     
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="noindent">and while both of these are proper differential equations, the version in (<a class="reference" href="#eqNonDiff">eqNonDiff</a>) is not.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="noindent">For some equations, like <script type="math/tex">y' = y^2</script>, the independent variable is not explicitly stated. We could be looking for a function <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script> or a function <script type="math/tex">y(x)</script> (or <script type="math/tex">y</script>
of any other variable) and without any other information, any of these is correct. Usually, there will be information in
the problem statement to indicate that the independent variable is something like time, in which case everything
should be written in terms of <script type="math/tex">t</script>. It is for this reason that Leibniz notation is preferred for derivatives; an equation
like
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac {dy}{dt} = y^2 </script> is unambiguously looking for any answer <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script>.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem2"><a id="x1-1002r2"></a>All of the below are differential equations <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             \frac{dy}{dt} = e^t y \qquad \qquad z'' + z^2 = t\sin{z}
    \end{equation*}</script>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
        \frac{d^4f}{dx^4} - 3x \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = x \qquad \qquad y''' + (y'')^2 - 3y = t^4.
    \end{equation*}</script>
Note that any letter can be used for the unknown function and its dependent variable. From the context of the equations, we can
see that the unknown functions we are looking for in these examples are <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script>, <script type="math/tex">z(t)</script>, <script type="math/tex">y(x)</script>, and <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script> respectively. The order of these equations are 1,
2, 4, and 3 respectively.
</div>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Solutions of differential equations</h4>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent">Solving the differential equation means finding the function that, when we plug it into the differential equation, gives a true
statement. For example, take (<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>) from the previous section. In this case, this means that we want to find a function of
<script type="math/tex">t</script>, which we call <script type="math/tex">x</script>, such that when we plug <script type="math/tex">x</script>, <script type="math/tex">t</script>, and <script type="math/tex">\frac {dx}{dt}</script> into (<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>), the equation holds; that is, the left hand side equals
the right hand side. It is the same idea as it would be for a normal (algebraic) equation of just <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">t</script>. We claim
that
</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    x = x(t) = \cos t + \sin t
\end{equation*}</script>
is a <em>solution</em>. How do we check? We simply plug <script type="math/tex">x</script> into equation (<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>)! First we need to compute <script type="math/tex">\frac {dx}{dt}</script>. We find that <script type="math/tex">\frac {dx}{dt} = -\sin t + \cos t</script>. Now let us compute the left-hand side of
(<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>). <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
      \frac{dx}{dt} + x = \underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t)}_{\frac{dx}{dt}} + \underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t)}_{x} = 2\cos t .
\end{equation*}</script>
Yay! We got precisely the right-hand side. But there is more! We claim <script type="math/tex">x = \cos t + \sin t + e^{-t}</script> is also a solution. Let us try,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t} .
\end{equation*}</script>
We  plug  into  the  left-hand  side  of  (<a class="reference" href="#eq1">eq1</a>)
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    \frac{dx}{dt} + x = \underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t})}_{\frac{dx}{dt}} + \underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t + e^{-t})}_{x} = 2\cos t .
\end{equation*}</script>
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent">And it works yet again!
</p><!--l. 112--><p class="noindent">So there can be many different solutions. For this equation all solutions can be written in the form
</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    x = \cos t + \sin t + C e^{-t} ,
\end{equation*}</script>
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent">for some constant <script type="math/tex">C</script>. Different constants <script type="math/tex">C</script> will give different solutions, so there are really infinitely many possible solutions. See
Normally a reference to a previous figure goes here. for the graph of a few of these solutions. We do not yet know how to
find this solution, but we will get to that in the next chapter.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="noindent">Solving differential equations can be quite hard. There is no general method that solves every differential equation. We will
generally focus on how to get exact formulas for solutions of certain differential equations, but we will also spend a little bit of time
on getting approximate solutions. And we will spend some time on understanding the equations without solving
them.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="noindent">Most of this book is dedicated to <em>ordinary differential equations</em> or ODEs, that is, equations with only one independent variable,
where derivatives are only with respect to this one variable. If there are several independent variables, we get <em>partial differential
equations</em> or PDEs.
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                     
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="noindent">Even for ODEs, which are very well understood, it is not a simple question of turning a crank to get answers. When you can find
exact solutions, they are usually preferable to approximate solutions. It is important to understand how such solutions are found.
Although in real applications you will leave much of the actual calculations to computers, you need to understand what
they are doing. It is often necessary to simplify or transform your equations into something that a computer can
understand and solve. You may even need to make certain assumptions and changes in your model to achieve
this.
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="noindent">To be a successful engineer or scientist, you will be required to solve problems in your job that you have never seen before. It is
important to learn problem solving techniques, so that you may apply those techniques to new problems. A common mistake is to
expect to learn some prescription for solving all the problems you will encounter in your later career. This course is no
exception.
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Differential equations in practice</h4>
<img src="intro-ode0x.png" alt="picture"/>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent">So how do we use differential equations in science and engineering? The main way this takes place is through the process of
mathematical modeling. First, we have some <em>real-world problem</em> we wish to understand. We make some simplifying assumptions
and create a <em>mathematical model</em>, which is a translation of this real-world problem into a set of differential equations. Think back
to the example at the beginning of this section. We took a physical situation (a falling object) with some knowledge about how it
behaves and turned that into a differential equation that describes the velocity over time. Then we apply mathematics to get some
sort of a <em>mathematical solution</em>. Finally, we need to interpret our results, determining what this mathematical solution says about
the real-world problem we started with. For instance, in the example at the start of the section, we could find the
function <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script>, but then need to interpret that if we were to plug 10 into this function, we will get the velocity 10 seconds
later.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="noindent">Learning how to formulate the mathematical model and how to interpret the results is what your physics and engineering classes
do. In this course, we will focus mostly on the mathematical analysis. This will be interspersed with discussions of this modeling
process to give some context to what we are doing, and give practice for what will be seen in future physics and engineering
classes.
</p><!--l. 141--><p class="noindent">Let us look at an example of this process. One of the most basic differential equations is the standard <em>exponential growth model</em>.
Let <script type="math/tex">P</script> denote the population of some bacteria on a Petri dish. We assume that there is enough food and enough space. Then the rate
of growth of bacteria is proportional to the population—a large population grows quicker. Let <script type="math/tex">t</script> denote time (say in seconds) and <script type="math/tex">P</script>
the population. Our model is </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
      \frac{dP}{dt} = kP ,
\end{equation*}</script>
for some positive constant <script type="math/tex">k > 0</script>.
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem3"><a id="x1-3001r3"></a>Suppose there are 100 bacteria at time 0 and 200 bacteria 10 seconds later. How many bacteria will there be 1 minute from time 0
(in 60 seconds)?
</div>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent">Solution: First we need to solve the equation. We claim that a solution is given by </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             P(t) = C e^{kt} ,
    \end{equation*}</script>
where <script type="math/tex">C</script> is a constant. Let us try: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             \frac{dP}{dt} = C k e^{kt} = k P .

</p><!--l. 211--><p class="noindent">A few equations appear often and it is useful to know what their solutions are. Let us call them the four fundamental equations.
Their solutions are reasonably easy to guess by recalling properties of exponentials, sines, and cosines. They are also simple to
check, which is something that you should always do. No need to wonder if you remembered the solution correctly. It is good to
have these as solutions that you “know” to build from when we learn solutions to other differential equations later on. In <a class="reference" href="#fo:chapter">fo:chapter</a> we will
cover the first two, and the last two will be discussed in <a class="reference" href="#ho:chapter">ho:chapter</a>.
</p><!--l. 214--><p class="noindent">First such equation is </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
      \frac{dy}{dx} = k y ,
\end{equation*}</script>
for some constant <script type="math/tex">k > 0</script>. Here <script type="math/tex">y</script> is the dependent and <script type="math/tex">x</script> the independent variable. The general solution for this equation is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
    y(x) = C e^{kx} .
\end{equation*}</script>
We saw above that this function is a solution, although we used different variable names.

      \frac{dy}{dx} = -k y ,
\end{equation*}</script>
for some constant <script type="math/tex">k > 0</script>. The general solution for this equation is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
      y(x) = C e^{-kx} .
\end{equation*}</script>

      y(x) = C_1 \cos(kx) + C_2 \sin(kx) .

Since the equation is a second order differential equation, we have two constants in our general solution.

for some constant <script type="math/tex">k > 0</script>. The general solution for this equation is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}</script>
They are called the <em>hyperbolic cosine</em> and <em>hyperbolic sine</em>. These functions are sometimes easier to work with than exponentials.
They have some nice familiar properties such as <script type="math/tex">\cosh 0 = 1</script>, <script type="math/tex">\sinh 0 = 0</script>, and <script type="math/tex">\frac {d}{dx} \cosh x = \sinh x</script> (no that is not a typo) and <script type="math/tex">\frac {d}{dx} \sinh x = \cosh x</script>.

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem7"><a id="x1-4004r7"></a>In equations of higher order, you get more constants you must solve for to get a particular solution. The equation <script type="math/tex">\frac {d^2y}{dx^2} = 0</script> has the general
solution <script type="math/tex">y = C_1 x + C_2</script>; simply integrate twice and don’t forget about the constant of integration. Consider the initial conditions <script type="math/tex">y(0) = 2</script> and <script type="math/tex">y'(0) = 3</script>. We plug in our
general solution and solve for the constants: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{equation*} 
             2 = y(0) = C_1 \cdot 0 + C_2 = C_2, \qquad 3 = y'(0) = C_1 .
    \end{equation*}</script>
In other words, <script type="math/tex">y = 3x + 2</script> is the particular solution we seek.
