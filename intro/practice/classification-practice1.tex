\begin{exercise}
    Classify the following equations.  Are they ODE or PDE\@?  Is it an equation or a system?  What is the order?  Is it linear or nonlinear, and if it is linear, is it homogeneous, constant coefficient?  If it is an ODE\@, is it autonomous?

\begin{exercise}
    If $\vec{u} = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$ is a vector, we have the divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial z}$ and curl $\nabla \times \vec{u} = \Bigl( \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial z} , ~ \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x} , ~ \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial y} \Bigr)$. Notice that curl of a vector is still a vector.  Write out Maxwell's equations in terms of partial derivatives and classify the system.

\begin{exercise}%
    Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ be three functions of $t$ defined by the system of differential equations
    \begin{equation*} 
        x' = y \quad y' = z \quad z' = 3x - 2y + 5z + e^t
    \end{equation*}
    
    with initial conditions $x(0) = 3$, $y(0) = -2$ and $z(0) = 1$, and let $u(t)$ be the function defined by the solution to
    \begin{equation*}
        u''' - 5u'' + 2u' - 3u = e^t
    \end{equation*}
    with initial conditions $u(0) = 3$, $u'(0) = -2$, and $u''(0) = 1$. 
    \begin{tasks}
        \task Use the substitution $u=x$, $u' = y$, and $u'' = z$ to verify that $x(t) = u(t)$ because they solve the same initial value problem.
        \task What is the order of the system defining $x$, $y$, and $z$ and how many components does it have?
        \task What is the order of the equation defining $u$? How many components does that have?
